                <p>
                    We are an established community of like minded people whose intention is to great a strong 
                    community within the Memorial Drive Corridor.

                    After traveling around the world, we have realized that many communities have local cafes' where people gather
                    to share their daily experiences.  We would like to use this principle to serve this 
                    community.
