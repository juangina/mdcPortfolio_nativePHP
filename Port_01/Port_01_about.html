                        We are an established community of like minded people whose intention is to create a strong 
                        community of successful businesses along the Memorial Drive Corridor.

                        After traveling around the world, we have realized that many communities have local cafes' where people gather
                        to share their daily experiences.  We would like to replicate this idea to serve our 
                        community.
